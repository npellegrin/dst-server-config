This directory contains the sample clusters config

You can simply copy the directory you want to run on your server, in .klei/DoNotStarveTogether/

Then, the server can be started with ./dontstarve_dedicated_server_nullrenderer -cluster <cluster name> -shard <world>

Check the file HOWTO_START.txt in each cluster directory to learn how to start it
