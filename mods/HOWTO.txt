This directory contains the mod configuration you should put on the server side, in the "mods" directory of your don't starve together installation.

This configuration is common to all cluster you are running with a don't starve together installation.

You can of course duplicate the don't starve together installation directory if you want to separate the modded and non-modded executables.
Note that if your server does not declare the modoverrive.lua file, it will not be modded, even if the don't starve installation contains mods.
